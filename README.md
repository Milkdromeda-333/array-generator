# array-generator

This project was made because I needed to manually make a not-very-small array one too many times. 
I decided to make this in vanilla javascript to dust off my ol' JS skills after learning React for so long.
I'm very proud of this, and I plan on making more vanilla javascript mini projects and tools this way.

With this project I:

- Practiced determination. I forgot how to do not-React javascript. It was a long night.
- Learned to delete a git remote (because i added git to the wrong folderðŸ™ƒ)
- Learned that codesandbox is kinda crappy.

To be done:

[ ] add animation styling to the copy button after its clicked

[ ] add themes lol

[x] add button to clear array

[x] responsiveness
