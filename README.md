# array-generator

This project was made because I needed to manually make a not-very-small array one too many times. 
I decided to make this in vanilla JavaScript to dust off my ol' JS skills after learning React for so long.
I'm very proud of this, and I plan on making more vanilla JavaScript mini projects and tools this way.

With this project I:

- Practiced determination. I forgot how to do not-React JavaScript. It was a long night.

- Learned to delete a git remote (because I added git to the wrong folderðŸ™ƒ)

- Implemented animations without tutorials based on inspirations found on the web.
